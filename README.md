Getting Started

Next Steps
----------
1. Medium priority: Add CSS keyframe animation for message; also addresses issue of no user feedback after checking a guess with no correct colors
2. Medium priority: Add instructions for game play that can be toggled visible/hidden (perhaps through pop-up)
3. Low priority: Grey out check guess button if <4 colors selected in currentGuess
4. Low priority: Prevent users from being able to select more colors (render to game board) after they have won
5. Low priority: Allow users to choose easy or difficult mode; difficult mode would allow each color to appear 1+ times in the secretCode.
6. Low priority (or perhaps not needed): Add a StartGame button, event listener and handleNewGame function
